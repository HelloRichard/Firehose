      I am a chemical engineer who is learning programming skills. One day I will complete my tasks and master the coding language of ruby. I believe that coding is the future. Everywhere we go we take our cell-phone or use some technology and all of theses contains lines of codes. Without the skills of coding, life can not be as simple as we live. Therefore, coders are necessary for the future. Imagine how powerful a single line of code can be. It has the potential to operate a car. When thousands and thousands of lines come together they become one. The lines of codes can be looked as art in a gallery as there are multiple ways to execute a task. This is the beauty of coding.
